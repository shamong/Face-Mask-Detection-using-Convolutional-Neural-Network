# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project trains a CNN to detect face masks in images. Using a labeled Kaggle dataset, the CNN learns to classify masked vs. unmasked faces. It achieves an accuracy of 91.8% on unseen data, suggesting potential for real-world public health or security applications.
